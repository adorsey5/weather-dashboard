# :calendar: :partly_sunny::Server Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Challenge :partly_sunny: :calendar:

## Overview :book:
For this challenge I was assigned to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  Utilizing a Server Side Application Programming Interface (API), [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), to retrieve weather data for cities and using localStorage to store any persistent data.


### User Story :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Client's Acceptance Criteria :pencil2:
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
